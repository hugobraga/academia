  abstract = {A schedule-based approach, such as TDMA, is more efficient than a
	Contention-based approach in terms of energy saving by switching
	sensors into sleeping mode. However it does not use the transmission
	media effectively as each timeslot is dedicated to a sensor and therefore
	cannot be used by others should it be idle. Moreover a schedule-based
	approach requires a central node to manage and broadcast the schedule
	to other members, causing high delay and unscalability. On the other
	hand, contention-based protocols can be used in a distributed fashion.
	But contention-based protocols such as IEEE802.11 wastes a lot of
	energy in idle listening. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach
	between contention and schedule based protocols. The preliminary
	results show that our proposed approach uses transmission media more
	efficiently leading to lower delay while preserving energy for WSNs.

  abstract = {In this paper we describe the design, implementation and performance
	evaluation of a low-power spectrum agile medium access control protocol
	for wireless sensor networks. With the ever increasing popularity
	of wireless embedded devices and networks, spectrum is getting congested,
	which in turn leads to performance degradation. Since protocols are
	designed in isolation of each other without appropriate consideration
	for potential interferences and mechanisms for symbiotic coexistence,
	they fail to achieve the desired performance characteristics in realistic
	interfering environments. The performance degradation is more significant
	for low-power embedded networks as they remain handicapped when competing
	with less resource constrained networks. We design a protocol that
	allows sensor nodes to dynamically select an interference minimal
	channel for data communication. It does not pose any synchronization
	restrictions on the nodes and effectively handles the dynamics of
	the network such as new nodes joining and old nodes leaving the network.
	We describe the various energy efficient spectrum sensing features

  year = {2010},
  address = {Beijing, China},
  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks usually operate under light traffic loads.
	However, when an event is detected, a large volume of data may be
	generated and delivered to the sink. The demand for simultaneous
	data transmission may cause severe channel collision and thus decrease
	communication throughput in contention-based medium access control
	(MAC) protocols. In this paper, we introduce a novel receiver-centric
	data transmission paradigm, which takes advantage of the tree structure
	that is naturally formed in data collection of a sensor network to
	assist scheduling of channel access. On the tree structure, a receiver
	is able to coordinate its multiple senders' channel access so as
	to reduce channel contention and consequently improve communication
	throughput. The protocol seamlessly integrates scheduling with contention-based
	medium access control. In addition, to ensure reliable data transmission,
	we propose a sequencebased lost packet recovery scheme in a hop-by-hop
	recovery pattern, which could further improve communication throughput
	by reducing control overhead. We present the performance of our receiver-centric
	MAC protocol through measurements of an implementation in TinyOS
	on TelosB motes and extend the evaluation through ns-2 simulations.
	Compared with B-MAC and RI-MAC, we show the benefits of improving

  abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have nodes that are small in size and
	are powered by small batteries having very limited amount of energy.
	In most applications of WSN, the nodes in the network remain inactive
	for long periods of time, and intermittently they become active on
	sensing any change in the environment. The data sensed by the different
	nodes are sent to the sink node. In contrast to other infrastructure-based
	wireless networks, higher throughput, lower latency and per-node
	fairness in WSN are imperative, but their importance is subdued when
	compared to energy consumption. In this work, we have regarded the
	amount of energy consumption in the nodes to be of primary concern,
	while throughput and latency in the network to be secondary. We have
	proposed a protocol for energy-efficient adaptive listen for medium
	access control in WSN. Our protocol adaptively changes the slot-time,
	which is the time of each slot in the contention window. This correspondingly
	changes the cycle-time, which is the sum of the listen-time and the
	sleep-time of the sensors, while keeping the duty-cycle, which is
	the ratio between the listen-time and the cycle-time, constant. Using
	simulation experiments, we evaluated the performance of the proposed
	protocol, compared with the popular Sensor Medium Access Control
	(SMAC) (Ye et al. IEEE/ACM Trans Netw 12(3):493-506, 39) protocol.
	The results we obtained show a prominent decrease in the energy consumption
	at the nodes in the proposed protocol over the existing SMAC protocol,
	at the cost of decreasing the throughput and increasing the latency
	in the network. Although such an observation is not perfectly what
	is ideally desired, given the very limited amount of energy with
	which the nodes in a WSN operate, we advocate that increasing the
	energy efficiency of the nodes, thereby increasing the network lifetime
	in WSN, is a more important concern compared to throughput and latency.
	Additionally, similar observations relating energy efficiency, network
	lifetime, throughput and latency exist in many other existing protocols,
	including the popular SMAC protocol (Ye et al. IEEE/ACM Trans Netw
	12(3):493-506, 39). &copy; 2009 Springer Science+Business Media,

	access control protocols highlights the limitations of existing techniques.
	Two alternative strategies are considered which exploit the centralised

	control protocol is presented which uses the aerial platform as a
	centralised coordinator, gathering topology information from the
	network and using it to compute energy and delay efficient schedules

	to assign capacity to nodes on a dynamic basis without any form of
	node addressing. It supports direct transmission to an aerial platform
	serving as a centralised sink, removing the huge energy burden associated
	with multi hop relaying. It is shown that direct transmission to
	an aerial platform provides the most energy efficient solution and
	rapid transfer of packets over a single hop. Use of a platform as
	a centralised coordinator provides significant gains with respect
	to conventional distributed scheduling within the network, and supports
	the transfer of data to multiple ground based sink nodes. &copy;

	Network (WSN) had been designed on top of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol
	along with some added features to meet the especial requirements
	of a WSN. However the Back-Off scheme of S-MAC is based on a fixed
	Contention Window (CW) size. This is known as a significant sort
	of trouble spot in S-MAC in the sense that the delay produced during
	collisions and idle listening can be so critical to the limited battery
	lifetime of a sensor node. IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol follows a static
	approach for obtaining the back-off time and resets the CW to its
	default minimum upon just one successful transmission and doubles
	it each time it faces a collision. While the back-off algorithm of
	IEEE 802.11 suffers from fairness for its faulty behavior in both
	high and low traffic loads, the back-off mechanism in S-MAC suffers
	from a fixed CW size. Reducing the undesired idle listening time
	caused by unnecessary long back-off times when traffic is low and
	also decreasing the probability of collisions in situations with
	high traffic load due to the fixed CW size in S-MAC have motivated
	our research. We have tried to come up with a dynamic back-off algorithm
	for SMAC that can extract the current traffic information of the
	network and engage them in estimating the contention window from
	which the back-off time is chosen. Our approach is a proactive algorithm
	to get the CW of the neighboring nodes ready before contending for
	the medium. The performance of our algorithm has been measured in
	terms of average delay, average throughput, delivery ratio, and average
	energy efficiency. It is shown that our proactive protocol has reduced
	the delay up to 47% and has decreased the energy consumption up to
	above 15% over the current S-MAC implementation. The delivery ratio
	and throughput have been improved up to 44% and 28% respectively.

  abstract = {Enabling quality of service (QoS) applications over battery-constrained
	wireless sensor networks (WSNs) poses significant challenges, because
	of the special characteristics of such networks. Developing real-time
	applications for WSNs necessitates the development of new communication
	protocols capable of achieving application-specific QoS and at the
	same time save energy. In this paper, we continue our previous work
	on developing and improving our EQ-MAC protocol, which is designed
	specifically for WSNs to reduce energy consumption and provides QoS
	guarantees through the use of the service differentiation concept.
	The proposed protocol consists of two subprotocols: Classifier MAC
	(C-MAC) and Channel Access MAC (CA-MAC). C-MAC is responsible of
	classifying gathered data at sensor nodes based on its importance.
	The CA-MAC is an energy conserving medium access mechanism which
	uses a hybrid scheduling technique. CA-MAC saves energy by differentiating
	between control and data messages. Data messages are assigned scheduled
	slots with no contention (here we have to emphasize that slots are
	assigned only to those nodes that have data to send, this allows
	an efficient energy use of the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
	slots), whereas short periodic control messages are assigned random
	access slots. To study the performance of the EQ-MAC protocol, we
	have conducted several simulation experiments on Network Simulator
	(NS-2) to evaluate and compare the performance of our protocol against
	S-MAC and Q-MAC protocols. Simulation results demonstrate that EQ-MAC
	outperforms the other two protocols and achieves a significant improvement
	in terms of the energy expenditure and delivery ratio. Under prioritized
	traffic, EQ-MAC is comparable to Q-MAC in average latency, while

  abstract = {The availability of low cost, multifunctional embedded devices have
	become ubiquitous due to their wide ranging application that includes
	monitoring Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagged objects to
	ambient conditions such as temperature and humidity. Also, these
	devices can be equipped with a camera and then deployed in hostile
	environments. A key characteristic of these devices is that they
	can communicate wirelessly and form an ad-hoc, Wireless Sensor Network
	(WSN). Devices in a WSN then collaboratively monitor environment
	factors or objects, and forward data back to one or more central
	nodes. A key challenge in WSN is ensuring nodes operate in the order
	of months as they have limited energy resource, and it is impractical
	to replace their batteries due to their large numbers, and they may
	be deployed in inaccessible terrains. Hence, it is critical that
	these devices or nodes employ energy efficient protocols. To this
	end, we present PairWise, a novel, low power, time division multiple
	access (TDMA) based protocol for use in WSNs. PairWise is easily
	deployable in large scale WSNs as nodes are not synchronized globally.
	Instead, they synchronize and establish a pair of channels with each
	of their neighbors independently. Each channel hops pseudo randomly
	in time according to a seed and maximum rendezvous period (MRP).
	Hence, nodes using PairWise experience very minimal to no collision
	during communications. Apart from that, higher layer protocols are
	able to control the MRP of each channel such that a node's duty cycle
	matches the observed traffic load. We have implemented PairWise in
	the ns-2 simulator, and compared it to Sensor Medium Access Control
	(S-MAC) and a TDMA MAC. Our results show PairWise to have very low
	power consumption whilst ensuring packets have minimal delays. Moreover,
	PairWise has a high goodput with increasing node density, where goodput
	is defined as the number of packets that are transmitted by each
	node pair successfully over a given total number of packets. <sup>1</sup>

	Mote, Rockwell's WINS nodes and the IEEE 802.15.4 Zigbee, have enabled
	support for single-transceiver, multi-channel communication. The
	task of channel assignment with minimum interference, also named
	as the 2-hop coloring problem, allows repetition of colors occurs
	only if the nodes are separated by more than 2 hops. Being NP complete,
	development of efficient heuristics for this coloring problem is
	an open research area and this paper proposes the Dynamic Channel
	Allocation (DCA) algorithm as a novel solution. Once channels are
	assigned, a Medium Access Control protocol must be devised so that
	channel selection, arbitration and scheduling occur with maximum
	energy savings and reduced message overhead, both critical considerations
	for sensor networks. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1)
	development and analysis of the DCA algorithm that assigns optimally
	minimum channels in a distributed manner in order to make subsequent
	communication free from both primary and secondary interference and
	(2) proposing CMAC, a fully desynchronized multi-channel MAC protocol
	with minimum hardware requirements. CMAC takes into account the fundamental
	energy constraint in sensor nodes by placing them in a default sleep
	mode as far as possible, enables spatial channel re-use and ensures
	nearly collision free communication. Simulation results reveal that
	the DCA consumes significantly less energy while giving a legal distributed
	coloring. CMAC, our MAC protocol that leverages this coloring, has
	been thoroughly evaluated with various modes in SMAC, a recent protocol
	that achieves energy savings through coordinated sleeping. Results
	show that CMAC obtains nearly 200% reduction in energy consumption,
	significantly improved throughput, and end-to-end delay values that
	are 50-150% better than SMAC for our simulated topologies. &copy;

  abstract = {Efficiency in any wireless sensor based application relies significantly
	on the medium access control it implements. It is not likely that
	we will see in the near future a unified MAC protocol for wireless
	sensor networks that is suitable for all wireless sensor applications.
	In this context, we propose an event based medium access control
	(EB-MAC) that is tailored for event based systems. Typically, event
	based systems are characterized by having long periods of inactivity
	and short abrupt periods of high data contention when an event is
	detected. High data traffic is generated simultaneously from all
	sensors detecting the event to deliver captured data. ER-MAC arranges
	data transfer dynamically using an election based scheduling technique.
	When data transfer begins, each sensor at a time starts sending data
	packets in a contention free environment. The protocol is implemented
	on MicaZ sensor motes where it showed efficiency in reliability,
	throughput and energy conservatiOn. The algorithm is compared with
	an implementation of B-MAC with RTS/CTS on MicaZ where it showed
	its superiority in throughput and latency. &copy; 2009 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper presents C-MAC, a new MAC protocol designed to achieve
	high-throughput bulk communication for data-intensive sensing applications.
	C-MAC exploits concurrent wireless channel access based on empirical
	power control and physical interference models. Nodes running C-MAC
	estimate the level of interference based on the physical Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio
	(SINR) model and adjust the transmission power accordingly for concurrent
	channel access. C-MAC employs a block-based communication mode that
	not only amortizes the overhead of channel assessment, but also improves
	the probability that multiple nodes within the interference range
	of each other can transmit concurrently. C-MAC has been implemented
	in TinyOS-1.x and extensively evaluated on Tmote nodes. Our experiments
	show that C-MAC significantly outperforms the state-of-art CSMA protocol
	in TinyOS with respect to system throughput, delay and energy consumption.
